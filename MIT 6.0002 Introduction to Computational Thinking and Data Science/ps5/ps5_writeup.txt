Problem A4:
● What difference does choosing a specific day to plot the data for versus
calculating the yearly average have on our graphs (i.e., in terms of the R2
values and the fit of the resulting curves)? Interpret the results.
	Choosing to average temps over the year decreases our spread, increasing R2 giving us a better fit, and
	decreases the SE/slope ratio

● Why do you think these graphs are so noisy? Which one is more noisy?
	They're noisy becuase of the incredible daily fluctiations in temps, difficulties in measuring temp, and
	time of day when temp was measured. The daily plot is more noisy since the yearly average plot has averaged
	out some of the noise associated with temp variability.

● How do these graphs support or contradict the claim that global warming is
leading to an increase in temperature? The slope and the standard
error-to-slope ratio could be helpful in thinking about this.
	The second plot showing yearly averages shows a more convincing arguement that yearly temps are increasing
	and not due to chance bassed on the SE/slope value.

Problem B:
● How does this graph compare to the graphs from part A (i.e., in terms of
the R2 values, the fit of the resulting curves, and whether the graph
supports/contradicts our claim about global warming)? Interpret the
results.
	This graph has even less variablilty and greater R2 value and lower SE/slope value. This is because in
	averaging yearly temps over many cities we can now control for regional fluctiations as well as daily
	fluctiations in temps.

● Why do you think this is the case?
	We are now averaging regional fluctiations as well.

● How would we expect the results to differ if we used 3 different cities?
What about 100 different cities?
	3 different cities may be too few to average out national temp differences. 100 cities would further
	increase our R2 value by decreasing variability

● How would the results have changed if all 21 cities were in the same region
of the United States (for ex., New England)? 
	Our results then would be pretty similar to Problem A4.II as we aren't really averaging out regional
	fluctiations

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem C:
● How does this graph compare to the graphs from part A and B (i.e., in
terms of the R2 values, the fit of the resulting curves, and whether the
graph supports/contradicts our claim about global warming)? Interpret the
results.
	Here we have "smoothed" the data by taking a 5 year average. This further accounts for variability in temp
	data. Our R2 value continues to rise and the SE/slope value decreases. This plot provides support
	for an upward trend in global (or at least national) temperatures. It is convincing evidence for global
	warming.

● Why do you think this is the case? 
	Because we've further smoothed the data and averaged out even more noise/variability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probelm D2.I:
● How do these models compare to each other?
	As the number of degree increases the R2 value keeps increasing.

● Which one has the best R2? Why?
	The degree 20 model but that is because we are allowing for too many degrees of freedom; we have overfit
	the model

● Which model best fits the data? Why? 
	Since we know where this data comes from, I argue the degree 1 model best fits the data, but the empirical
	answer is the 20 degree model.

Problem D2.II:
● How did the different models perform? How did their RMSEs compare?
	The degree 1 model performed best with the lowest RMSE, the degree 2 model second, and degree 20 model
	performed the worst.

● Which model performed the best? Which model performed the worst? Are
they the same as those in part D.2.I? Why?
	Best = degree 1, Worst = degree 20. This is not the same as earlier because now we are looking at test data
	The degree 20 model was overfitted and represented the training data well but could not predict test data
	well.

● If we had generated the models using the A.4.II data (i.e. average annual
temperature of New York City) instead of the 5-year moving average over
22 cities, how would the prediction results 2010-2015 have changed?
	Probably not by too much. We would still see the same general trends amongst degree 1,2 and 20. However,
	we may see poorer R2 and RMSE values because of increased spread of the data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem E:
● Does the result match our claim (i.e., temperature variation is getting
larger over these years)?
	No, in fact it shows temps are getting less varied ove these years.

● Can you think of ways to improve our analysis? 
	We can work on imrovng the R2 value by looking at more data or trying different models. Temperature
	variability may be complex and non-linear. We could look at different degree models along with data from
	more cities/regions to look for trends and improve R2.
