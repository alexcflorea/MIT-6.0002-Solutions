------------
1. What happens to the total population before introducing the antibiotic?
	5.A - Increases steadily up to a max capacity
	5.B - Increases then starts to decline as birth rate too low to keep up with population
2. What happens to the resistant bacteria population before introducing the antibiotic?
	5.A - Increases then starts to decline as birth rate too low to keep up with population
	5.B - Increases then starts to decline as birth rate too low to keep up with population	
3. What happens to the total population after introducing the antibiotic?
	5.A - Declines all the way to num of resistant bacteria imediately
	5.B - Declines all the way to num of resistant bacteria imediately
4. What happens to the resistant bacteria population after introducing the antibiotic?
	5.A - Slowly grows as resistant bacteria now have lower pop density to reproduce
	5.B - Slowly decreases as resistant bacteria reproduction can't keep up with number of deaths,
	      seems to converge to zero after ~250 steps
